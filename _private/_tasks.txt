in nmma/conversion.py:
    allow on the fly eos_sampling 
        -> should import eos from eos_param
        -> if tabulated should become available in generation!
    restructure Ejecta Fitting for less repetitiveness



IDEAS: make generation / analysis / run more modular
    - e.g parse config with corresponding flags for inclusion of GW, KN, GRB, EOS, CHEM

    -> first modify treatment of config- file, then explore parser behaviour

    -> introduce gw-free inference
